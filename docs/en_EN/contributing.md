# Tag Explanation

We defined four groups of tags based on requirements:

* fix: Project needs correction
* new: New features added to the project
* bug: Errors found in the project
* cve: Incorrect severity level

Three groups were also defined based on system definition:

* os: Android
* os: Linux
* os: Windows

We defined three categories based on project type:

* CI/CD: Issues originating from control flow
* Ezgal: Issues originating from the framework itself
* Ezlang: Issues originating from the interpreter

This makes it easier for people to filter their tasks when discussing and contributing.
