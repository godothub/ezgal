To ensure that developers and users can describe the relationship between supply and demand in a standardized way, ensuring that communication processes do not generate misunderstandings, the following definitions have been provided for some important concepts. Generally speaking, we assume that developers and users understand these concepts.

## Logical Definitions

- Visual Novel Game (NVG): A type of game where the main content is written text, with images used as auxiliary tools.
- Text Adventure Game (TAD): An electronic game that uses text-based scripts to interact with players, combining graphics, music, and performances.
- Galgame: A genre of games centered around interactions between anime characters.
- Low Code Development: A development mode where a small amount of low-cost handwritten code is used to quickly develop applications.
- Game Engine: A software framework used for game development, focusing on core dependencies in ezgal.

## Function Definitions

- Full Screen Box (FSB): The FSB is a window specifically designed for visual novels (NVG), occupying most of the screen space and facilitating text descriptions.
- Dialogue Box (Dialogue): The dialogue box is a window specifically designed for text adventures (TAD) and generally occupies the bottom part of the screen, primarily used to highlight character dialogues.

## Language Definitions

- ezlang: ezlang (light language) is an interpreter used by ezgal to convert developer's script languages into customized JSON formats. Its core idea is to achieve low learning costs through script-based low-code development.
- Script: Scripts include both script and performance parts, which form the core concept of ezlang.
- Script: One of the core concepts in ezlang is a script document that simulates a play-by-play format, including text, dialogues, and options.
- Performance: The performance includes elements such as image control, sound effects, and special effects, serving as additional functions in ezlang.
